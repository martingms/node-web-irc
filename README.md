## TODO

### Urgent

* Make private messages not show up for everyone.

### Not-so-urgent

* Make private messages work, both receiving and sending.
* Tidy up client-side code, and make an "api" so that it gets easier to
  work on for different sides.
* Remove paperboy, node.js server should be strictly a bridge.
* Move all dependencies off npm to git clones in ./lib instead.
